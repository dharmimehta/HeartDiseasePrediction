    "> *What is heart disease?* <br>\n",
    "The term “heart disease” refers to several types of heart conditions. In the United States, the most common type of heart disease is coronary artery disease (CAD), which can lead to heart attack. As reported by the **National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (NCCDPHP)**, heart disease is the leading cause of death for men, women, and people of most racial and ethnic groups in the United States.\n",
    "Technology has a huge influence in all the markets today. With the help of technology it has now become possible to find solutions to once incurable diseases. Machine Learning is one such important aspect of technology, that can process large amounts of patient data beyond the scope of human capability, then reliably convert that analysis into medical insights that help clinicians plan and deliver care. The prediction of heart disease is one example of how machine learning can be useful. Below is the statistical chart to display the severness of heart disease.\n",

    "\n",
    "> *Problem Statement:* <br>\n",
    "We are provided with data on almost 300 medical patients who were evaluated for the presence of heart disease.  Some were diagnosed as having heart disease, others were found to NOT have heart disease.  The goal here is to build a classification model that can help us predict the diagnosis given just 5 patient characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "> *How does this help?* <br>\n",
    "With help of our model prediction, the patient can see a doctor in case of positive outcome of heart disease and take necessary precautions."
