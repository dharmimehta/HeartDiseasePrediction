# HeartDiseasePrediction
Problem Statement:
We are provided with data on almost 300 medical patients who were evaluated for the presence of heart disease. Some were diagnosed as having heart disease, others were found to NOT have heart disease. The goal here is to build a classification model that can help us predict the diagnosis given just 5 patient characteristics.

How does this help?
With help of our model prediction, the patient can see a doctor in case of positive outcome of heart disease and take necessary precautions.
